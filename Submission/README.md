# python-challenge

This challenge involved two separate assignments. 
    Pybank ended up covering 85 weeks of change for a 86 week data set.  Using python scripting we were expected to write a script that would not only find out the total number of months and profit / loss for the entire length of the data set.  But we also needed to script it in such a way that it would account for the changes from one month to the next, finding the average of those changes across the entire breadth of the "change_list".  It also needed to be able to find the greatest gain and the greatest loss, account for that data and print all of the findings to a text document.

    Pypoll used a data set that was taken from a small election.  The analysis invovled finding out how many votes were cast in total, as well as the share of those votes that each  candidate received.  From here, our script needed to reflect who won the election, and to print all of the aforementioned data into a text file to be included in the submission.
